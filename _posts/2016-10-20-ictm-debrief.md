A couple weeks ago we had a great time presenting at [2016 Annual Meeting](http://www.ictm.org/index.php?option=com_jevents&task=icalevent.detail&evid=1) of the Illinois Council of Teachers of Mathematics ([ICTM](http://www.ictm.org/)). The organizers even sent us a lovely thank you letter, perhaps before the hotel told them what the Presidential Suite looked like after our meeting. ;-) As a supplement to our announcement [post](http://blog.everydaycomputing.org/2016/09/16/ltec-at-ictm-2016/), below you will find the slides from our various sessions. Please feel free to sound off in the comments section with any feedback!

    <td><h3>Computer Science for All: Lessons Learned from Mathematics</h3>
The recently passed Every Student Succeeds Act identifies Computer Science as part of a "well-rounded education" that all students should have. Can CS educators learn anything useful from 30+ years of efforts to reform mathematics education? Letâ€™s not reinvent the flat tire.</td>

    <td><h3>Using Computation to Define Computational Thinking</h3>
Many have attempted to define computational thinking (CT) and associated learning goals. How can we synthesize this valuable but often disparate work? Teams at UChicago and UIUC are analyzing the landscape of CT research to develop learning trajectories for CT in elementary school.</td>

    <td><h3>Touching Screens or Touching Objects: Which is Better?</h3>
Concrete manipulatives have been used in classrooms for years. Now digital manipulatives are more common. When is it important to use physical manipulatives, and when do digital manipulatives offer advantages? Come and discuss the affordances and costs of touchscreens versus physical objects.</td>

    <td><h3>Intervening for Students Who Consistently Struggle in Math</h3>
In this session, we will briefly discuss some of the research behind academic persistence and productive struggle. The bulk of this session will be introducing self-regulated strategies as alternative approaches to support these struggling learners to get the most out of your math instruction.</td>

    <td><h3>Computer Science and Common Core Math K-5</h3>
There is a natural intersection between computer science and mathematics.  Can the two be meaningfully integrated in a K-5 curriculum?  This poster will describe what we have learned as we develop curriculum that weaves rich computer science learning experiences into a Common Core based math curriculum.

We are a team of researchers and teachers working with K-5 students to understand how to integrate mathematics instruction with computing. We will share some of the math/CS lessons we developed and the research questions and tools we are exploring. Our special focus is on student collaboration.</td>
